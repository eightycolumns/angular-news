### Try it out

### Run the unit tests

Run `npm test`.

### To-Do
  * The API returns paginated comments in chronological order (i.e., oldest first), but they should probably be displayed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest first).
  * Data retrieved via the API could be cached to improve performance.
  * Some components and pipes need more rigorous testing.
  * The header's Sections, Search, and Settings icons could be fully interactive.
  * Currently, users can post and delete comments. They could be allowed to edit comments too.
